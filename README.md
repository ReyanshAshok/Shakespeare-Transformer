# Shakespeare-Transformer
🎭 GPT Text Generator - Shakespeare Edition
Overview
This project implements a Transformer-based GPT model trained on Shakespearean text. The model uses advanced attention mechanisms to generate text in the style of Shakespeare with improved coherence and fluency.

Features
✅ Transformer-Based GPT Model (with Multi-Head Self-Attention)
✅ Masked Self-Attention for Better Sequential Learning
✅ Cross-Self Attention for Context Awareness
✅ Feed-Forward Layers & Softmax for Improved Generalization
✅ Trained on Shakespeare’s Works
✅ Validation Loss: 1.6

Tech Stack
Python 🐍
PyTorch (for Transformer implementation)
Tiktoken (for tokenization)
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)


Dataset
The model is trained on tinyshakespeare.txt, a dataset containing a subset of Shakespeare’s works.

Model Architecture
The GPT model is built using:

Token & Positional Embeddings
Multi-Head Self-Attention (for contextualized word representations)
Masked Self-Attention (prevents information leakage during training)
Cross-Self Attention (for deeper contextual learning)
Feed-Forward Network (enhances learning capacity)
Softmax & Cross-Entropy Loss


Achievements
🔥 Implemented Multi-Head Self-Attention for Coherent Text Generation
🔥 Utilized Masked Self-Attention to Improve Sequential Learning
🔥 Integrated Cross-Self Attention to Boost Contextual Awareness
🔥 Achieved Validation Loss: 1.6

Future Improvements
🔹 Fine-tune with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
🔹 Train on a larger dataset for richer text generation
🔹 Experiment with deeper Transformer layers
